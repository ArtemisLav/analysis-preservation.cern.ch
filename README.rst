What is this?
-------------

`CERN Analysis Preservation <https://analysispreservation.cern.ch>`_ is a data preservation service developed and run at `CERN <https://home.cern/about>`_ to provide a centralized platform for high energy physicists to store and retrieve analysis information. It is currently targeting analysis information provided by the four largest LHC experiments - ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb.

This is the source code behind this project licensed under the `GNU Public License 2.0 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html>`_. As it is designed to support physicists during their research, the data gathered is not accessible by anyone outside CERN. If you wish to get access to data from CERN please visit the `CERN Open Data Portal <http://opendata.cern.ch>`_.

If you want to know more just go to our `official documentation <https://cernanalysispreservation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
