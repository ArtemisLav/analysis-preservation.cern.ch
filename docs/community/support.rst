Team and Community
------------------

Our core team is based at CERN including both information scientists and computer scientists working in the scientific information service and in CERN IT.

We work closely together with preservation and outreach representatives within the four largest LHC collaborations and related projects like RECAST, DASPOS and REANA (you can find a short information on these projects in :doc:`this list <../community/related-projects>`).

Many contributions are made by and achieved through the help and support from physicists who are working on one of the four largest LHC collaborations.

Contact us if you want to join the community!
