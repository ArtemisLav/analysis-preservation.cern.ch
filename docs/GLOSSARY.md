 A draft analysis decription on CERN Analysis Preservation.

 ## Docker/Docker Container

 An open source software that allows arbitrary software to be wrapped inside a so called "Docker container". This container mimics the environment the software usually runs in. Thus, it can be preserved and run relatively easy.

 ## Kubernetes

 An open source software used by [REANA](./related-projects.md#reana) for managing containers (usually Docker containers) on a cluster. This includes scheduling and scaling tasks and executing the software wrapped inside the containers.

 ## Yadage Workflow

 A set of JSON schemas with rules how to chain them together to describe analysis workflows. They are wrapped in a container (e.g. Docker) and can be executed by Yadage both locally (e.g. on your laptop) and distributed (e.g. on Kubernetes or [REANA](./related-projects.md#reana)).
